The real-time algorithm involves using an adaptive time differencing technique for the generation of adaptive differenced sequences of single-frequency code and phase observations. The sequences are used for determining thresholds and for the detection and determination of a receiver clock jump and cycle slips. The cycle slip values are fixed by rounding-up float values obtained via weighted least squares adjustment, following the elimination of the receiver‚Äôs high-order clock drift at every epoch. The performance of this new technique was investigated with simulated cycle slip values and with different types of receiver clock jumps at millisecond and microsecond levels. It achieved 100% detection and correction of all types of receiver clock jumps; between 97 to 100% cycle slip detection; and between 96.9 to 100% cycle slip correction including cycle slips of ¬±1 cycle, for different rates of observations acquired by different fixed and mobile GNSS receivers. The algorithm thus facilitates precise timing and positioning on standalone low-cost single-frequency GNSS devices.","tags":[],"title":"Receiver Clock Jump and Cycle Slip Correction Algorithm for Single-Frequency GNSS","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"In an operational sense, satellite clock time offset prediction (SCTOP) is a fundamental requirement in global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) technology.

Now, satellite clock predictability is affected by two factors: (i) the clock itself (i.e. the oscillator, the frequency standard etc.) and (ii) the prediction algorithm. This research focuses on aspects of the latter. Using satellite clock data---spanning across several years, corresponding to multiple systems (GPS and GLONASS) and derived from real measurements---this thesis first presents the results of a detailed study into the characteristics of GNSS satellite clocks. This leads onto the development of strategies for modelling and estimating the time-offset of those clocks from system time better, with the final aim of predicting those offsets better. The satellite clock prediction scheme of the International GNSS Service (IGS) is analysed, and the results of this prediction scheme are used to evaluate the performance of new methods developed herein. The research presented in this thesis makes a contribution to knowledge in each of the areas of characterisation, modelling and prediction of GNSS satellite clocks. Regarding characterisation of GNSS satellite clocks, the space-borne clocks of GPS and GLONASS are studied. In terms of frequency stability (and thus predictability) it is generally the case that the GPS clocks out-perform GLONASS clocks at prediction lengths ranging from several minutes up to one day ahead. There are three features in the GPS clocks---linear frequency drift, periodic signals and complex underlying noise processes---that are not observable in the GLONASS clocks. The standard clock model does not capture these features. This study shows that better prediction accuracy can be obtained by an extension to the standard clock model. The results of the characterisation and modelling study are combined in a Kalman filter framework, set up to output satellite clock predictions at a range of prediction intervals. In this part of the study, only GPS satellite clocks are considered. In most, but not all cases, the developed prediction method outperforms the IGS prediction scheme, by between 10% to 30%. The magnitude of the improvement is mainly dependent upon clock type.","tags":[],"title":"Satellite clock time offset prediction in global navigation satellite systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.

These are determined with significantly lower prediction uncertainties than may currently be obtained using the IGS ultra-rapid predictions. At prediction length of one day IGS prediction errors are commonly of the order of several ns for all GPS satellite clocks. In comparison the new techniques offers to limit prediction errors at the order of 1 ns for prediction lengths of one day in the newer generation Block IIR and IIF satellites. The factors contributing to the uncertainties in the IGS predictions are discussed. The application of a Kalman filter based prediction algorithm is shown to produce close to optimal predictions.","tags":[],"title":"Development of a Kalman filter based GPS satellite clock time-offset prediction algorithm","type":"publication"}]
