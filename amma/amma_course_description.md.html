		**BARC0130: Advanced Mathematical Modelling & Analysis (AMMA)**
	*Term 1, Academic Year 18/19* -- [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk)
	From 1000 to 1600 on Mondays in the G12 Seminar Room @ [UCL Here East](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/here-east/)
	[Dr. Santosh Bhattarai](https://s-bhattarai.github.io), <s.bhattarai@ucl.ac.uk>
	Prof. Marek Ziebart, <m.ziebart@ucl.ac.uk>

In this module, students continue exploring mathematical concepts that 
underpin the analysis and design of practical engineering systems, building 
on the Mathematical Modelling & Analysis (ENGF0003) module from Year 1.  

Topics that will be covered include:
- Series & Approximations
- Linear Algebra
- Numerical methods for differential equations
- Statistics (least squares analysis and estimation, hypothesis testing)

The main aims of the module are:
	1. Develop understanding in a range of advanced mathematical techniques.
	2. To be able to solve mathematical problems using appropriate mathematical concepts.
	3. To understand the interface between Mathematics and Engineering and Architectural Design.
	4. To apply computer programming to solve a range of mathematical problems in the context of Engineering and Architectural Design.
	5. To communicate results and what they mean in an appropriate context.

Throughout the module, students will build up their own repository of re-usable 
code that will be used for systematically analysing data sets and 
presenting the outputs in a meaningful way.

# Requirements 
Prerequisite modules
:	ENGF0003 Mathematical Modelling & Analysis I

Textbooks
:	The module is self-contained in the sense that the teaching and assessment is based entirely on topics covered in lectures and problem-solving classes, with lecture notes, slides and worksheets uploaded onto Moodle on a weekly basis. However, for those looking for alternative explanations of key concepts and additional practice (both good things!), we recommend [#Stroud11] and [#Kreyszig11].

Equipment
:	You will require an up-to-date (2017 onwards) version of MATLAB running on your personal laptop, which you are encouraged to bring along to all of the problem-solving workshops. Instructions for setting up MATLAB on your personal laptop are [here](amma_matlab0.md.html).


Time
:	Attendance is compulsory for all lectures and problem-solving workshops. Attendance will not be formally recorded, however, poor attendance will be noted by module tutors. This module is worth 15 UCL credits, which requires 150 learning hours: 50 hours of lectures and tutorials; 100 hours independent study. 

# Feedback and Assessment

Students will be assessed in this module through four pieces of coursework 
(each worth 10% of the final module mark) that will be
assigned throughout Term 1, and a closed-book final exam (worth 60%) that will take place in January
of Term 2.
