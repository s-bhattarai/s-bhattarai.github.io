**BARC0130 AMMA: Fourier Series I**
	Worksheet 2: Investigating the properties of Fourier Series

# Basic Definitions (special case where period = $2\pi$)

The function, $f(x)$, can be expressed by its Fourier Series, $F(x)$, at those points where $f(x)$ is continuous, if:

- it is a periodic function such that $f(x+2\pi)=f(x)$, where $2\pi$ is the period
- it defined and it is single-valued 
- it is piecewise continuous (i.e. there are a finite number of finite discontinuities) over a single period

If these properties, the **Dirichlet conditions**, are satisfied, the Fourier Series of $f(x)$ is:

\begin{equation}
F(x) = \frac{a_0}{2} + \sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty{a_n\cos(nx)} + \sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty{b_n\sin(nx)}
\end{equation}

where the coefficients of $F(x)$ are:

\begin{equation}
a_0 = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}{f(x)dx}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
a_n = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}{f(x)\cos(nx)dx}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
b_n = \frac{1}{\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}{f(x)\sin(nx)dx}
\end{equation}

# Question

Write out the analytical expression of the function depicted in Figure [fr_sawtooth]. Note that the pattern repeats itself in both directions.

Discuss whether or not this function satisfies the Dirichlet conditions? 

Find the coefficients $a_0$, $a_n$ and $b_n$ of the Fourier Series, $F(x)$, for this function. What is the value of $F(x)$ at $2\pi?$ 

Using MATLAB, compute the Fourier Series up to $n=20$ in the domain $0 \leq x < 6\pi$. Plot 
the values of $x$ against $F_n(x)$, where $F_n(x)$ is the Fourier Series expansion of function
truncated at $n$.

## Guidance

This is a problem that has has several components to it. You need to break it down and solve each component of the problem in sequence.
