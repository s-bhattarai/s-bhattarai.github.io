Data-driven decision making is increasingly 
important in all aspects of the modern world, so much so that 
data is now compared to oil, and Data Scientist has been described as the 
[sexiest job of the 21st century](https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century). Largely, this is due to 
recent advances in technology that enable us to collect and process 
unprecendented volumes of data on just about anything and 
everything[^sensors_smartphone]. The impact of this is seen across 
all sectors (e.g. health, transport, education, technology, etc.), including
within organsiations involved in the design and engineering of the built
environment. It is useful, therefore, to explore (or revisit) the fundamental 
ideas of Statistics -- the science of using data to investigate reality -- 
in order to better understand the underlying methods that 
produce and make use (or misuse[^statistics_lies]) of the data sets that 
influence our personal and professional lives, and so this is what we will do 
in this series of lectures and tutorials. Statistics is a vast subject area
and there are many ways to *think about* and *do* Statistics. Here, where 
possible, we will use specific, real-world data sets (related to built environment) 
to guide us in our exploration of the subject. 


[To-do: Describe the learning objectives here?]
- Focus on methods for working with quantitative (or numerical) data
- Use MATLAB to explore large data, mult-dimensional data sets 
- Develop some experience in working with time-series data

[^sensors_smartphone]: Consider your smartphone. What sensors is your device
equipped with? What do these sensors measure? How are the measurements from 
these sensors processed to provide you, the smartphone user, with useful 
information that guides you in the decisions you need to make in your daily
life?

[^statistics_lies]: Too often, either through ignorance, or more worryingly, 
through a wilful effort to misinform others, data are misused and statistics 
are misrepresented. There are many subtle, and not-so-subtle, ways in which 
statistics can deceive us -- some of these are explained with great style and 
humour in the classic book by [Darell Huff](#Huff91). [To-do: Find a current 
example of data misuse.]

# Definitions

First, let's start by making sure that we're all talking the same 
language -- with some definitions[^definition_notes]. 

__Statistics__ (always plural, with a capital __S__) is the science of 
conducting studies to collect, organise, summarise, analyse and draw conclusions 
from data[#Bluman13]. __Data__ (plural) are the values of the variable(s)
being studied (determined through observation or 
measurement[^meas_obs_data]), where a __variable__ represents some 
characteristic of the thing (or things) being studied. A single data value 
is a __datum__. Note that, in general, the values assumed by variables need 
not be numbers (e.g. they could be the words in a book). If the value of a 
variable is determined by chance, then we call it a __random variable__. A 
collection of observations or 
measurements, of a single variable or a finite number of variables, is a 
__data set__. A __statistic__ (singular, with a lower-case __s__) 
is a number that describes some characteristic of a variable, or combination 
of variables, from a data set being studied.

Mathematical Statistics is the application of probability theory 
(a branch of Applied Mathematics[^map_maths]) to the study of data.

[NOTE: Could go into the axioms of probability and most important results here, 
but in a sense this should be revision from the year before.]

[^definition_notes]: The conventions, definitions and 
notations given here will be applied throughout the 
lecture notes, worksheets, coursework and the final 
exam for the Year 2 module, Advanced Mathematical Modelling and Analysis 
(BARC0130). Be aware that books on (and not on) the reading list may use 
different conventions, definition and notations for the same terms. 

[^meas_obs_data]: The terms data, measurements and observations are used more
or less interchangeably throughout these notes.

## Describing Data

Data can be:

- Qualitative: data does not have to be numerical
- Quantitative
   - Discrete
   - Continuous

## Descriptive Statistics

## Inferential Statistics 

## Investigating the Relationship between Two Variables


## Summary

# Collecting Data

No more than half a page on data collection. In these lectures, we focus on 
summarising, presenting/visualing, analysing and inference. 

## Observability

## Primary and Seconday

## Sampling
- Sample size
- Selection bias
Example: "Do you like to answer questionnaires?"
- Unseen biases

# Organising Data

## Metadata
- Data about data: Metadata

## Quality Control
- Gross Errors
- Systematic Errors
- Random Errors

# Summarising Data

## Measures of central tendency 
- Mean
- Median
- Mode
- Midrange

# Measures of data scatter
- Standard deviation (or variance)


## Hypothesis Testing -- using data to answer questions
