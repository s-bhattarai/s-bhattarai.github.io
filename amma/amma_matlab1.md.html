# Review of Fundamentals

We start by reviewing some fundamental topics from Year 1, in order to get 
everybody back up to speed as quickly as possible. 

## Matlab Environment

In the figure [frMatlabIDE] below:

## Scripts

## Functions

## The 'plot' command

## Maintaining a re-usable code base

# MATLAB data types

# Loading Data

Explore in-built Matlab functionality - does Maltab already provide tools for processing datasets you're studying?
[Ways to Import Text Files](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/import_export/ways-to-import-text-files.html)

- CSV (other delimiters)
- text files 
- Importing Data Formatted in Excel
- JSON

If not, try writing your own data file reader - using textscan. Reading files line by line and parsing.

# Organising Data

Is it because the last section doesn't have a 

# Exploratory Data Analysis

Finally starting to get into it now.
