**Programming with MATLAB for Advanced Mathematical Modelling & Analysis**
	Santosh Bhattarai

# Getting Started

For this module, it will be massively beneficial for you to have an 
up-to-date (2017 onwards) version of MATLAB running on your personal laptop, which 
you are encouraged to bring along to all of the problem-solving workshops. 

Check [here](https://uk.mathworks.com/support/sysreq.html) 
to check whether or not your laptop meets the minimum system requirements 
for running MATLAB 2018a. If you don't have one already, create a [Mathworks](https://uk.mathworks.com/login) 
account using your UCL email address. 
Download the MATLAB file(s) required for installing MATLAB 2018a from the [UCL Software Database](https://swdb.ucl.ac.uk).

!!!WARNING
   Windows and Linux users are required to download **two** files, MacOS users 
   only need to download one. The overall size of the download file is about **12GB**.
   
   *Make sure you have enough space on your hard drive before you start the download!* 


If you already have a previous version on MATLAB installed on your computer, 
you can either continue to work with that or update your installation to 
the latest release according to the instructions given [here](https://uk.mathworks.com/help/install/ug/update-an-existing-installation.html).

!!!
   These course notes were developed using MATLAB 2018a.

When you run through the MATLAB installer, you will have the option to configure
your installation. For the moment, I suggest you install the following:

- Matlab (obviously)
- Symbolic Math Toolbox
- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox

It is possible to add other toolboxes later on, if they are required. 


# Review of Fundamentals

We start by reviewing some fundamental topics from Year 1, in order to get 
everybody back up to speed as quickly as possible. 

## Matlab Environment

In the figure [frMatlabIDE] below:

![Figure [frMatlabIDE]: Matlab Integrated Development Environment](images/matlab_ide_screenshot.png)

## Scripts

## Functions

## The 'plot' command

## Maintaining a re-usable code base

# MATLAB data types

# Loading Data

Explore in-built Matlab functionality - does Maltab already provide tools for processing datasets you're studying?
[Ways to Import Text Files](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/import_export/ways-to-import-text-files.html)

- CSV (other delimiters)
- text files 
- Importing Data Formatted in Excel
- JSON

If not, try writing your own data file reader - using textscan. Reading files line by line and parsing.

# Organising Data

Is it because the last section doesn't have a 

# Exploratory Data Analysis

Finally starting to get into it now.
